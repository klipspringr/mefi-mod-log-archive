<div> <em>1. Is Metafilter policy, "do not say 'Fuck x' where x is anyone."</em> <br/>
<br/>
Yes, in most cases. Allow me to explain, historically there has been no prohibition on non-hateful cursing into the void on the site, but cursing at another person (be it a member, staff, or other people). However, we always try to lean towards leniency, there are exceptions when it comes to public persons, and the subject at hand. Saying fuck [x] in an obituary post about said person is not the same as in a post about their work, or some terrible thing they have done, and even then there are, <a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26734/When-he-dies">and will be exceptions.</a><br/>

Admittedly, that mod note, could have used more context. On top of the name calling it was early threadshitting and also a potential derail. Now, if there's a desire to set policies that are clearer and less obscure in their application, that is something I think we all support and can work towards with the new board once seated.<br/>
