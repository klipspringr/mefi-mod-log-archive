<div> One comment removed for pulling information from a member's profile and posting it in a thread, <a href="https://faq.metafilter.com/166/profile_linking_etiquette">which is not ok per this FAQ entry</a>, please don't do that. This may not have been meant maliciously, or the info was viewed as being on topic, but either way,  avoid pulling information from a user's profile. <br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants to do this, they'll need to explicitly asked for permission to do so <em>and</em> the member has to give explicit permission for you to share the information in a thread.  <br/>
