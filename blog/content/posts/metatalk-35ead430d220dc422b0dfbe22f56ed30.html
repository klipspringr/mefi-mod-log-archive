<div>Just a mod note responding to flags on this and other recent MeTa post that was asking about past MetaFilter or Ask MetaFilter posts: It's totally ok to ask about previous site posts on MetaTalk, it's part of the function of this subsite. People <em>can</em> use AskMe instead, but posts like these are totally fine for MetaTalk. But please just use one or the other, not both, thanks.  </div>
