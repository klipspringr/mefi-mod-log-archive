<div> A few comments against the guidelines removed. Please do not call other users trolls. But more importantly: <em><a href="https://www.metafilter.com/guidelines.mefi">Speak for yourself, not others</a></em>: Let's avoid downplaying the importance of race, specially in a thread about Black representation.
As the guidelines say, <em>avoid speaking on behalf of other people and discussing their experience like an academic topic; invite them to speak for themselves instead</em>!  </div>
