<div>Violet Blue, you're derailing this thread, please stop doing that.<br/>
<br/>
There's a consistent pattern of behavior here where you post a thread on the front page, people  have disagreements with you about the subject and then you try to police the thread. When told to stop you begin accusing people of organizing against you and/or contacting the mods to get their comments taken down. <br/>
<br/>
The I/P subject is a complex one with lots of sides and emotions. It is recommended that you stop trying to argue with every single person who disagrees you. It is recommended that you stop accusing others of working in some organized fashion against you. People simply disagree with your take on things and that's perfectly fine.<br/>
<br/>
Please stop posting comments in this thread. If you don't, we'll have to start removing your comments and/or issue temporary bans of increasing length, so please stop. </div>
