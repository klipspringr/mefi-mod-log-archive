<div><em>Do we, as a community, think that cursing public figures for their public actions should be forbidden? And do we know where the line is dividing people like NPH from people like JKR?</em> <br/>
<br/>
Speaking as a mod, these two questions are the most important ones to decide upon, IMO.<br/>
