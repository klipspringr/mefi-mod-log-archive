<div><em>Mods: how often are you adding this tag vs how often are users using it themselves, and what criteria are you using to decide?</em><br/>
<br/>
No specific numbers. I'll add the tag if I think it needs to be added, based on the political football noticed in the news. <br/>
<br/>
I do think it's a broad term and not everyone's definition will be the same. I'd recommend people occasionally looking under a blocked tag to see if they're missing something they might be interested in.  </div>
