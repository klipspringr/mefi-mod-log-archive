<div> <a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26604/Revisiting-posts-that-disappear-from-the-MeTa-queue#1438788">Sparky Buttons</a>: "<i>I think it would be helpful if the posts that dont make it through the queue are noted on the mod log.</i>"<br/>
<br/>
Agreed and<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HedITV2uKYCMavOewUSJ6nrbLoxlegFWfD3QJ5vLW3Y/edit?tab=t.0"> it was requested back on March 22 that the  moderation log on the new site record that information</a>. Mentioning that to make it clear there's no objection to making that information visible, just no clear technical way at them moment, but restless_nomad has suggested a work around.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26604/Revisiting-posts-that-disappear-from-the-MeTa-queue#1438791">pdb</a>: "<i> is that decision and the reason why communicated to the person who created the post (via MeMail or other communication method)? Because if not, it absolutely should be. #pleaseanswer<br/>
</i>"<br/>
<br/>
Yes, the member is emailed the reason why it wasn't published. Both of the mentioned MeTas were emailed.  <br/>
<br/>
<em>It's possible that the process should be changed to "posted but closed with deletion reason" rather than just not posted,</em><br/>
<br/>
Decent idea, will talk it over with the other mods, thanks for suggesting it!<br/>
<br/>
<em>Out of interest, why do messages or notes in flags have more weight in the decision than (hypothetically) a MeTa that might be 90% decent discussion amid the fighty-ness?</em><br/>
<br/>
They don't necessarily have more weight, it's very conditional. In this particular instance, I'm mentioning them as way that members have communicated, along with emails, what they think of particular situations. </div>
