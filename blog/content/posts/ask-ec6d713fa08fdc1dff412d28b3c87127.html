<div>Hi all. It's great that people are giving suggestions about what to do in the future or to just return the  device, but the OP needs help with what's going right now with the current device, so please focus answers on that part of the question to help the OP!

No comments have been removed, but again, future comments should focus on what's going on now. </div>
