</i>"

Hi all, couple of things about all this.

1. Please don't derail a post by making a post about the poster. There's a subject of every thread and a basic principle of the site is that you talk about the subject, not the poster.  

Just move on from the post about a subject you don't  like or preferably create a post about something you do enjoy talking about.

2.  Lemkin, you're coming off as hostile in terms of repeatedly posting about a subject you know that upsets people. I'm not saying to stop about posting about AI, at least not at this point. But as someone who posts a lot (which is fine), you need to be aware that this is a community site and be mindful of bringing up subjects that anger parts of the community.

No comments have been deleted, but it's time for people to move on and stop derailing this post. If the derailing continues, we make start removing comments and if that doesn't help the situation, may be forced to issue time outs.  </div>
