<br/>
Two users have been banned and it's been fairly clear it was because of transphobia. <br/>
<br/>
That said, I am seeing users  breaking the rules/guidelines with the justification that they are in the right for doing so. I don't think that's exactly wrong, but do believe it's important to note and pump the brakes on members breaking rules/guidelines because they believe it's morally justified, end of story. That's line of thought/feeling is completely understandable, but don't want to encourage members feeling that they're morally justifiable to do this whenever they want. <br/>
<br/>
We're probably gonna disagree about that, which is fine, we'll handle these situations as they come up.<br/>

<br/>
Previously they had been mention in discussions about someone to keep an eye on. When  june_dodecahedron brought up their comments this afternoon, I went through their comments again, thought "Yes, it's time for ban", talked it over with loup, who agreed a ban was fine, and so they were banned.  </div>
