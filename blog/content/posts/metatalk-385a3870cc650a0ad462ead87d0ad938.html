<div>Hey, thanks for asking about this.<br/>
<br/>
My understanding is that we post or message the person directly with <a href="https://mefiwiki.com/wiki/ThereIsHelp">the ThereIsHelp link</a> in situations when someone seems danger of committing or idealizing suicide. The most recent question wasn't explicitly either of those, so it falls in a gray area and looking at it, I think it's ok to leave it up since people are commenting about why it's not a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
Being more liberal about posting the link is a good idea, so I'm mentioning it in the mod Slack to get everyone on the same page. Thanks for the suggestion! </div>
