<div> <em> Transphobia needs to be grounds for an immediate and irreversible ban. Nothing less will do.</em><br/>
<br/>
Yes, a full ban is in order. Transphobia has now place here. Period. The temporary ban while the moderation team discussed the issue was a decision to stop the user right there and allow some time for us to discuss collectively, not because we need to decide our stance when it comet to transphobic content, but because we take full ban seriously and discuss them together as a team.</div>
