<div>2 comments removed for continuing a derail.

<a href="https://www.metafilter.com/209493/TERF-Island#8743003">As mentioned previously,</a> folks can move on from that derail. They can take it to MeMail, email, or start a new MetaTalk thread, but definitely keep the "who said the vitriolic comment first" out of this thread. Comments that do so will be removed.  </div>
