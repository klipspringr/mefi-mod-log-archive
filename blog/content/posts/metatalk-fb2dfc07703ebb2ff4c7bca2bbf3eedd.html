<div>To be clear, I'm not against getting rid of the queue.<br/>
<br/>
No specific data on hand about deleting posts from un-queued sites. <br/>
<br/>
Projects is different though because it's specifically for "<a href="https://faq.metafilter.com/#8">for members to toot their own horn and link to something that they have done</a>". Do we care if someone signs up just to post their project on Projects? If someone signs up and puts up a link to a 'One Day Bathroom Remodel' site and says they were the designer for the site, do we let it stand? Matt (the original creator of MetaFilter) <a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/10484/Ive-got-the-basics-of-MeFi-Projects-working-now#258572">thought commercial projects were fine</a>, but things have changed in those 20 years.  <br/>
<br/>
Not a big concern, IMO, at the moment. If it starts turning into that, we can rethink things. Probably worth thinking about what constitutes a Project, <a href="https://faq.metafilter.com/#8">because shockingly there isn't a firm definition in the FAQ</a>.  </div>
