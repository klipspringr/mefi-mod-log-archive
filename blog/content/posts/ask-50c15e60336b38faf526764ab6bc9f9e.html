<div> <i>These are the films that check the boxes for "laugh until you cry" humor. </i><br/>

Hey, just a reminder that those sorts of films aren't what the OP was asking for. They want to know "What movies start with the main character dying, and then flash back to the life of that character and events leading up to the death?" so please just stick to suggestions along those lines, thanks!<br/>
