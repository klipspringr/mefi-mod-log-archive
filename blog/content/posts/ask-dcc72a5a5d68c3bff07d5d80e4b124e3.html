Your proposed email sends friendly enough to me. Maybe change "should be used" to "I prefer they be used"?</i>"<br/>

Hi, just a note that the wording "I prefer they be used" can be seen as offensive and transphobic. There is no "preference", a person's pronouns are what they are and no one should have to say they have a preference on that  matter. A person's pronouns are their pronouns, period.  </div>
