Derailing comment removed. There have been a couple of previous mod notes (<a href="https://www.metafilter.com/209187/AI-induced-mental-illness#8734164">1</a>, <a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26673/It-was-really-unacceptable-to-delete-this-post#1444553">2</a>)about these sort of comments from you Diskeater, and since they seem to be continuing after requests for them to stop, we're going to move on to timeouts if another one is made. <br/>
<br/>
No one wants to do that, we're in agreement that you have every right to question Board or staff statements and actions, but you can't keep derailing other threads to do. <a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26657/A-MeFiCoFo-board-election-should-be-held-in-June">This the thread about elections</a>, please keep queries and/or complaints about elections to that or similar threads.
