<div><a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26647/Draft-Bylaws#1441981">ssg</a>: "<i>Brandon or another mod, can you share some details on how the sussing out of sock puppets might work? Is there anything in the database that indicates known or potential sock puppets? Or are we just working off of email addresses used to sign up and other similar data?</i>"<br/>
<br/>
Short answer: yes, there’s backend stuff to detect sock puppet accounts, but as a non-technical person, I can’t and won’t get into details. <br/>
<br/>
Things always go badly when a non-techie attempts to explain technical stuff to people who are familiar with the technology (ie coding). <br/>
<br/>
Probably not a great idea to go into details. No need to leave doors open.<br/>
