<div>Final update from the OP:<blockquote>It turns out the scene was from Season 4, Episode 1 of Parks and Recreation:<br/>
<br/>
Andy: Hey, so Tom offered me a job again. As my manager, what do you think I should do?<br/>
April: Well what do you want to do?<br/>
Andy: I think it’d be kind of cool to work for Tom.<br/>
April: So take it.<br/>
Andy: But working at a start-up can be kind of risky.<br/>
April: So don’t take it.<br/>
Andy: But Tom told me to follow my dreams.<br/>
April: So take it.<br/>
Andy: But this isn’t my dream.<br/>
April: So don’t take it.<br/>
Andy: I don’t know what to do.<br/>
April: Me neither.<br/>
Andy: You give such good advice. Babe, I love you.<br/>
April: You’re welcome.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all!</blockquote> </div>
