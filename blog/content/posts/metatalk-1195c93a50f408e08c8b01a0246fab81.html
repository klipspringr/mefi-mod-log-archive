<div><a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26621/the-need-for-clear-action-against-transphobia#1439929">ftrtts</a>: "<i><strong>Brandon Blatcher</strong>, do you still stand by your comment that <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/208430/Transgender-Athletes-The-Fencing-Issue#8712767">told june_dodecahedron to chill</a>?</i>"<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I stand by my comment, made in moderator role, that told june_dodechedron to stop telling other people to fuck off. That is a rule on the site, has been for a while.  <br/>
<br/>
The feeling and desire to say that is understandable, but we do want to members to avoid deciding who deserves to be told to fuck off. 'Cause that tends to slide down to personal interactions ("you don't like my comment? Well, F off or F you!") so we tend to discourage that anywhere on the site</div>
