<div>Ok, i got an example of this happening with this comment of mine, as the first comment and only comment in the thread, <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/211567/LEON">https://www.metafilter.com/211567/LEON</a>, on mobile, using the Classic theme. On desktop, the problem does not appear when using the Classic theme.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone seeing the small type in the first comment when it's the only comment?  </div>
