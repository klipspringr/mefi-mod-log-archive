<div><a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26756/A-good-old-fashioned-SEO-spammer#1448409">phunniemee</a>: "<i>Well, posts to the blue require a link. I assume that the link that has apparently been removed (used to be we changed those to example.com, guess that changed) had something more obvious in it.</i>"<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, the usual procedure is as phunniemee described, change the url of a spammy link to example.com. But in this case, the link was just raw unlinked html (https://metafilter.com as opposed to <a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com">metafilter</a>). So removing that unlinked html text removed any indication of where the link was. <br/>
<br/>
In those situations in the future, we'll leave a note indicating the html/link  was removed</div>
