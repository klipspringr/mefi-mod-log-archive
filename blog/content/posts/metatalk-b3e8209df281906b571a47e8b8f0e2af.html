<div> No idea why this test post popped up today, it shouldn't have.  It was a glitch, possibly the  system having <a href="https://music.metafilter.com/1028/HI-IM-ON-METAFILTER-AND-I-COULD-OVERTHINK-A-PLATE-OF-BEANS">too many beans</a>? 

We're just gonna close this up hope this isn't a sign of the system becoming sentient. </div>
