<div><a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26655/Updated-draft-bylaws-for-MeFiCoFo#1442706">mediareport</a>: "<i>Yeah posting the call for candidates on a Friday night wasn't ideal, which is why it is important that Brandon or one of the other mods follow up on this comment suggesting they'd be happy to add a link to a call for candidates to declare to the sidebar, banner and all of the subsites.</i>"<br/>
<br/>
Links have been added to the banner and sidebar.<br/>

Here's some suggested verbiage for the posts: <blockquote>Hi all,<br/>
Brief reminder that MetaFilter is a community run site, with a board of directors that are responsible for managing the site. <br/>
<br/>
Currently we have <a href="https://faq.metafilter.com/360/site-transition-faq">a three member Board</a>, and were looking at planning elections to vote in a new board. If you're interested in running for a seat on this new board, <a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26654/A-thread-to-announce-candidates-for-the-board">please declare your intentions in this MetaTalk thread</a>.<br/>
<br/>
We're still figuring exact details (like the new board will probably have more than 3 members) but for now we're looking to see how many people would be interested in running for a seat. So again, if you're interested, please declare in the above mentioned thread. This doesn't bind to do anything, just that you're interested.<br/>
