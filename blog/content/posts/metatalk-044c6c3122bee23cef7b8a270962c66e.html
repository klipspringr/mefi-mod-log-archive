<div>Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Clearly there's still a several issues going on and staff should work ensure next month's update goes better, more on that below.<br/>
<br/>
This includes working with 99_ to finish out ironing out issues with connections to various financial data (like PayPal), working with frimble on what can be done to prevent future site downtime's similar to what occurred on 7/26/25, getting the BiPOC minutes for a recent meeting finished, and keeping members informed about any policy changes, updates or discussions. <br/>
<br/>
Note that MetaFilter does have a free account with <a href="https://uptimerobot.com/">UptimeRobot</a> to monitor if the site is up and running (it checks every five minutes). This was done to help non-development staff know if and when the site goes down so we can communicate information to the community and as a backup to development monitoring.<br/>
<br/>
UptimeRobot did report when the site was down yesterday, enabling staff to ping frimble  and post to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/metafilter.bsky.social">our Bluesky account</a> that the site was down, along with updates. Will also check with frimble about making sure the status page accurately reflects whether the site is up or down. <br/>
<br/>
Finally, I think (without consulting with other staff members yet) that it would be good for staff to establish goals with each site update for the next month's site update. Doesn't have to be anything huge, especially as we're still in a transition phase with management, but definite goals to keep the site and community running as smoothly as possible, something like what is mentioned in the second paragraph of this comment. </div>
