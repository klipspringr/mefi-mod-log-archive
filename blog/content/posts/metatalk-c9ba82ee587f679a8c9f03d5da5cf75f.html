<div><em>I'm thinking the idea of having one page with all the committees, the elections, the boards.</em> <br/>
<br/>
I am working today on a General Information page that does things like this, it'll be mentioned in the Site Update, which is running a little late (should have been posted this week but waiting on some information)<br/>
<br/>
The site update should happen by Wednesday of next week at the very latest. If it doesn't, mods will make a post a MeTa explaining the delay.]
