<div><a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26742/Threadsitting-and-Implications-for-future-moderation#1447963">The Pluto Gangsta</a>: "<i>Brandon, as long as you're here do you want to comment on why, when other comments were modded out of that thread, the mod didn't name the poster even when they quoted the comment, but <em>you</em> decided to reproduce not only my comment but to put me on blast specifically?  Kinda feel like you put a target on my back there.</i>"<br/>
<br/>
There are 5 official mod comments in that thread (<a href="https://www.metafilter.com/210290/Charlie-Kirk-shot-at-event-in-Utah#8764048">1</a>, <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/210290/Charlie-Kirk-shot-at-event-in-Utah#8764211">2</a>, <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/210290/Charlie-Kirk-shot-at-event-in-Utah#8764223">3</a>, <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/210290/Charlie-Kirk-shot-at-event-in-Utah#8764278">4</a>, <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/210290/Charlie-Kirk-shot-at-event-in-Utah#8764367">5</a>), 4 of them by me, 3 of which use the MeFi Quote feature to name who made the comments. You are not specifically being called out, it's just a function of being on the internet and the convenience of  using <a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26605/Better-MetaFiltering-through-scripting">MeFiQuote</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Otherwise, am going to leave the mod comment as is and request that everyone avoid bringing up The Pluto Gangsta anymore in this thread. It's not a command, just a request on their behalf.</strong><br/>
<br/>
About larger questions:<br/>
Mods should moderate comments and situations as they normally do on the site, with little regard as whether a person is a board member or not. There are probably hypotheticals where board status might matter, but I view that more as sending a message with advice or about some site history, but that's about it. Moderation should proceed as on escalating scale that starts with talking and requests and only moving on to ban if nothing else works. Definitely worth considering how to work out a such a situation if things go that way. But having to go that route will be a rare thing is my guess. Still worth considering ahead of time, IMO.<br/>

Thank you so much for taking the time and making the effort. You points are non-American thoughts ðŸ’­ and necessary for the community to be reminded of.<br/>

<a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26742/Threadsitting-and-Implications-for-future-moderation#1448027">i used to be someone else</a>: "<i>just want a little more clarity on <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/210290/Charlie-Kirk-shot-at-event-in-Utah#8764223">this mod decision</a></i><br/>
<blockquote>Removed a comment saying "The only good nazi is a dead nazi" because site's Content Policy discourages calls for violence.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
Sure, the full comment was "He was a nazi. The only good nazi is a dead nazi." That comment was in reference Charlie Kirk and went a little over the line, in terms of advocating for his death. I should have made that clearer in the deletion note. <br/>

<br/>
Thank you and all the members of the MOC for the work y'all have done. <br/>
<br/>
FInally, candidate statements will be live in in the A.M. of Friday, September 12, starting after midnight. It'll probably take an hour or two to post and link everything, but it's happening!<br/>
