I could have had 1/1000th of empathy for her actually being afraid to face a stronger opponent with more reach due to body proportion and losing. But having competed with men the week before some of who were no doubt taller, stronger, and perhaps more talented than Sullivan, she was just being a bitch.</i>"

BlueHorse, this type of sexist language is not ok MetaFilter, it violates our <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/content_policy.mefi">Content Policy</a>, which is there to make it clear that the site is not a haven for hate speech. 

Please avoid using this type of language in the future, as it may lead to removal of content and/or a ban. For now I'm leaving the comment up to make it clear what's occurred. 

I'm assigning a day long ban and sending this note to your email. </div>
