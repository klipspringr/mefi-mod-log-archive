<div>Two comments made by DeepSeaHaggis have been removed and the user placed on an indefinite ban. The comments celebrated Kirk's death and also advocated for the death of Kirk's family and friends. That violates  several parts of the <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/content_policy.mefi">Content Policy</a> and possibly laws, so we're skipping warnings in this instance and going straight to a ban. It's only indefinite due to a single moderator being on duty and making the decision, I'll confer with the other moderators over the next couple of days about whether the ban should be permanent (I firmly think it should be, but it's best if there's agreement for permanent bans). 

If folks wish to discuss this action further, please make a post in <a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/">MetaTalk</a> or you can ask the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScd456dpbxpH7n-bKos12mlv5WQaTpJxwpWI9NUKLsaNb_LTA/viewform">Moderation Oversight Committee</a> to review this mod action. </div>
