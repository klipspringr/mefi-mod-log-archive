<div><a href="https://www.metafilter.com/209806/First-they-came-for-the-pornographers#8752250">xusifem</a>: "<i>Spinifex has an Indigenous land acknowledgement on their website and publishes books by Indigenous and lesbian authors on feminism, decoloniality, and anthropogenic climate change. I find that to be odd behavior for a right wing press.</i>"

As others noted, Spinifex's book of the week is <em>Terf Island: How the UK Resisted Trans Ideology</em>, which is a textbook definition of anti-trans, so stop trying to convince people that the Collective Shout and Spinifex has no problematic elements. This is not a request, just stop and if you feel you can't, then move on to another thread.

MetaFilter is unapologetically pro -trans, but also has firm rules about saying 'fuck you' or similar to other members, so let's avoid doing this in the future.

If anyone wants to discuss any of this further, email or MetaTalk are your options, avoid continuing the derailing this thread.
