Nope, as a black man born and raised in America,  you're dead wrong there. We may disagree in this instance and that's fine, but as black man born and raised in America, I do try to find the best in people and am willing to give <em>some</em> people a chance if I think there's potential for change.<br/>
<br/>
But that's a personal thing, and it doesn't have to be so as moderator if trans members and allies think differently about the  tiamat account. So we're making the ban permanent on that with notes and links to the previous 8 comments in this thread to make it clear to any future moderators how the community feels about reinstating that account. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you to everyone for speaking up and expressing their opinion about this, it definitely pushed things to make the ban permanent. </div>
