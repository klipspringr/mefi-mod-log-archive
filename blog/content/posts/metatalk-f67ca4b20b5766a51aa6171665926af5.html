<div><em>Were the mods actually planning to ban this user before this metatalk post went up?</em><br/>
<br/>
Yep. <br/>
<br/>
We aim to  avoid having one person ban a member with no conversation with other mods so that no person is dispensing bans as they see fit. So I gave CyberSlug Labs a week off to prevent them from  saying anything else on the site, emailed them why there getting the temp ban, and that a permanent ban was being discussed. <br/>
<br/>
I was pretty sure the other mods would agree with the ban, just wanted to touch bases with them to get that full agreement. It was pretty short conversation. <br/>
<br/>
Yes an argument could made that I should have just gone ahead and banned them, but again, it's important that we're not out here being total cowboys when banning people. Plus I was rocking a helluva head cold and felt a second opinion wouldn't hurt anything as long as CyberSlub Labs could no long post in the meantime.<br/>
