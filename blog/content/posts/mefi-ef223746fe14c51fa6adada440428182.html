MetaFilter post <a href="//www.metafilter.com/210657/What-is-Hamas">What is Hamas?</a> deleted.  Badly formatted propaganda that also manages to come off as trolling. 
<br/><br/>
Edited to add: Apologies for getting to this late, no one was on duty and the mechanism for alerting mods about heavily flagged posts seems to have broke, will get with frimble about that.
