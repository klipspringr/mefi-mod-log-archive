<div> Hey, Brandon's on duty today, will be around, but mostly listening, but here's a few responses to things brought up since my last comment:<br/>
<br/>
Posted about this MeTa in the mod slack and the use of CamelCase for tags. For the 'uspolitics' tag is there a preference for 'USPolitics' or 'UsPolitics'? <br/>
<br/>
The mods are open recalibrating on this and how and when we add tags to posts.  Have left a reminder to use CamelCase when adding tags with multiple words, but just fyi the tag that was added by a mod to the post in question was 'USPolitics']<br/>

See <a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26699/USPolitics-tag-added-but-why#1445450">this comment earlier in the thread</a> for the OP mentioning they had removed the tag themselves, which is totally fine. <br/>
<br/>
Members always have the ability to add or remove tags from their posts after the post as b</div>
