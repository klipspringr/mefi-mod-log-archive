<div>Several comments deleted. outgrown_hobnail's comments have been removed and they have been banned for a week. All replies have been left for context. Thank you for pushing back against this kind of Hateful and Insensitive comments. Calling people “shitbirds” is unacceptable. Please refer to the very top of the <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/content_policy.mefi">Content Policy</a>. 

Also, let’s avoid. Turning this, and any US politics post into a relitigation of the past elections;  let's focus on the issue at hand instead. </div>
