<div>"<i>Why are you deleting my comments but not his if you want to clean up the thread...</i>"

Original comment removed, but here's a public response:
You can take your concerns to email or MeTa, but you need to stop derailing this thread. 

No one is thinking less of you, certainly not me, but it's clear that another member would prefer not to interact with you, so please, just avoid interacting with them.

You're welcome to continue discussing the subject of this thread, but if you keep insisting on derailing it, we're going to have to ask you to leave the thread. </div>
