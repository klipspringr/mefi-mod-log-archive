<div><a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26721/MeFiCoFo-Board-Update-Aug-16-2025#1446658">TheophileEscargot</a>: "<i>Could the FAQ be updated to have the current list of board members, with NotLost instead of Gorgic?</i><br/>
<br/>
Have updated that FAQ entry to link to <a href="https://faq.metafilter.com/#358">the General Staff and Site Information page</a>, so that the list of Board members is in a single place, for easy updating.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Could the Steering Committee page be changed to the past tense, and a note added that it was disbanded in 2023?</i>"<br/>
<br/>
Mods don't have editing rights to that page, have passed the request on to frimble. </div>
