<div><a href="https://www.metafilter.com/212132/Free-Thread-Crazy-Human-Tricks#8811759">growabrain</a>: "<i>I've wanted to post an academic FPP on Metafilter about pornography, in order to stimulate a general debate about the topic (which is dear to my heart) and I wonder if it can be done without it being deleted. I know that the community is very politically-correct and protective and lots of people are offended by various subjects. So is it possible? The links I discovered are Wikipedia-worthy and couldn't pose any offense to anybody. So, if the consensus is 'better not', I'll keep them to myself.

Your opinion?... Grazie.</i>"

Moderator here, but not on duty.

There's no inherent restriction against a post about pornography, but obviously it's a sensitive topic that can spark various reactions in the comments. So be mindful of that and lean into the academic side of things. Probably a good idea to leave include a Content Warning and put the bulk of the post inside. 

<a href="https://www.metafilter.com/contact/">Feel free to email the mods a draft of the post</a> if you want any feedback about whether it's ok as a FPP (which you're not bound to follow). I imagine that as long it's handled with care and sensitivity, it should be fine. </div>
