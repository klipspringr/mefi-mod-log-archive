<div><small>[<em>So is it now a policy that mods should always leave a comment when they delete? People were asking for that for a while, it's great if that's true.</em><br/>
<br/>
Yes, it is policy that a mod should always leave an official note when something is removed. If you see it not happening, please <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/contact/">point that out by email</a> at least!<br/>
<br/>
Yes, some of us  were a bit forgetful when we started doing that, but at this point it should be happening as the default, no exceptions. If it isn't, please report it! <br/>
<br/>
(makes mental note to update FAQ entries that mention deleting by this evening)</small> </div>
