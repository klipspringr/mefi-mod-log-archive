<div>No major spam in Projects, it's pretty quiet in general. <br/>
<br/>
For submissions, I would just review them and make sure the project was doing what it said it was doing. There's only two I can think of that I rejected over the past year, one was asking for help with a game design and the other was essentially a stunt post.<br/>
<br/>
If we remove the queue, I'd expect more spammy posts over time, because people, but we'll see.  </div>
