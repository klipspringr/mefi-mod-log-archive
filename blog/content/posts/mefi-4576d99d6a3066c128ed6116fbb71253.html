<div>Removed several comments about a mod action. Folks are free to take those comments to MetaTalk, but they need to stop being in and derailing this thread. 

Also removed a comment and response telling someone to fuck off. The sentient is fine, but we ask that folks not tell others to fuck off as it encourages others to the same on other issues.

If folks want to talk about any of this, MetaTalk is the place to do it, not this thread. Thank you.</div>
