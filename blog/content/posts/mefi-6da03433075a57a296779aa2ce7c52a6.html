<div>Kadonoishi, you're derailing the thread by making it about Musk,  and/r how MetaFilter doesn't like Musk, instead of the actual subject. Stop it. 

You're free to make your own thread about Musk if you like, but you absolutely need to stop derailing this thread. If you can't, a timeout will be issued.

Several comments are in the process of being removed. </div>
