<div><a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26725/MeFiCoFo-Financial-Update-Aug-24-2025#1447046">99_</a>: "<i>Sorry, I was copying and pasting from an old draft. <strong>Revenue drop month over reduction of 20%</strong>.<br/>
<br/>
And I munged some HTML: third bullet under expenses should read: <strong>All other expenses comprise less than 2% of our monthly spend and are basically flat relative to June.</strong></i>"<br/>
<br/>
Post updated with these corrections and added the tag 'financialupdate' </div>
