<div><a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26767/MetaFilter-General-Site-Update-September-2025#1450088">Klipspringer</a>: "<i>It was launched in March 2025 as "a log of official mod comments and post deletions". However at some point recently the page title has changed to "Recent moderation comments" and it doesn't appear to list deleted posts any more. Could we be told why deleted posts are no longer listed?</i>"<br/>
<br/>
Hey, just ran through some tests where I created a post for the FPP, Ask, Anon Ask, FanFare, and MeTa, that order. The system correctly posted the FPP, then has glitched where a message is posted saying an old post was deleted, but it wasn't wasn't. Have let frimble know about that, they'll look into it. <br/>
<br/>
Checked the wayback machine and the mod seems to have always said "Recent moderation comments". Can you pinpoint a time when it said otherwise?<br/>
<br/>
Talked with loup, we agree it would  be best if the newly elected MeFiCoFo Board (<a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26773/Vote-for-the-MeFiCoFo-Board-of-Directors">voting ends October 14</a>) makes the decision on whether to expand the current moderation log.  <br/>
