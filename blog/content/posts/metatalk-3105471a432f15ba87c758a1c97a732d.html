<div>Members can ask for their account to be deleted. Currently when that happens, the mods ask if the member would be ok with making their posts and comments anonymous to preserve the history of that information while removing the attachment to their account.<br/>
<br/>
If the member says no, that's fine, then we remove all of their posts and comments.<br/>
<br/>
If the member says yes, then we make the author of their posts and comments anonymous.<br/>
<br/>
That rationale is that people should have control over their content and be allowed to redact or remove it for any reason. <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps clears this up!</div>
