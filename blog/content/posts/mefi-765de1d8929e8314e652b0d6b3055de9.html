Is it <em>because</em> they're a board candidate? Is that why they're getting the kid gloves treatment?</i>"

Hey, this is major derail, so we've removed the comment. But here's a few notes about the concerns that you've posted, emailed, and left flag notes about:

To wit: Candidate statements for <a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26740/Election-Timeline">2025 Board election of the MetaFilter Community Foundation (MeFiCoFo)</a>, will be posted on this Friday, Sept 12 in the a.m. (ET). You (and anyone else) are encouraged to bring up this concern with the candidate at that time. 

Otherwise, the flags on their comments in this thread have been reviewed and found to be ok in the context of a larger discussion about political violence. For here you're welcome to take this MetaTalk or file a request for review with the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScd456dpbxpH7n-bKos12mlv5WQaTpJxwpWI9NUKLsaNb_LTA/viewform">Moderation Oversight Committee</a> .

Otherwise please refrain from continuing this derail as it may cause further comment removals and/or requests that you leave this thread.</div>
