<div> One comment removed for not answers the question. As  much as "pilots drag-racing jumbo jets" sounds fun or amusing, sharing your thoughts about it isn't what AskMetaFilter is for. Instead its <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/content_policy.mefi">content policy is stricter than most of the site</a> and AskMe comments should solely be about answering the question.<br/>
<br/>
But if anyone has info or story about drag racing jumbo jets, by all means make a post about it on <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/">the main page of MetaFilter</a>. </div>
