<div><a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26852/Replies-to-comments#1456418">bitteschoen</a>: "<i>Just kidding, sorry, I just wanted to try out the MefiQuote thing because this is the very first time I hear about this. Très cool. And really should be the default maybe?</i>"<br/>
<br/>
Added <a href="https://faq.metafilter.com/353/what-is-mefiquote">a FAQ entry about MeFi Quote</a> with the help of Darling Bri and frimble. It has a couple of videos showing usage and how to turn off and on.<br/>
<br/>
That entry may be updated once it's decided whether it's on by default, but for now there is reference entry to link to!<br/>
