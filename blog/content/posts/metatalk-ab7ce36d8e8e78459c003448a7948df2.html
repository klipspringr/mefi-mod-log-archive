<div><a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26648/Help-plan-MeFis-coming-election#1442656">mediareport</a>: "<i>Well dang, looks like <a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26654/A-thread-to-announce-candidates-for-the-board">someone has just posted a thread for candidates to declare</a>. Excellent. Brandon, I believe you'd recently written* you would put links to a candidate declaration thread in the sidebar and banner. Can you please do so now? Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
*I'd find it but there's a tornado nearby I definitely remember it tho</i>"<br/>

Can do, but we currently have a bunch of links in the nav bar, so adding more <i>might</i> break the site for a minute, so lets see how this goes! Mentioned only if case people see the site do...something odd for a few seconds. </div>
