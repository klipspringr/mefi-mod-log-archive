MetaTalk post <a href="//metatalk.metafilter.com/26784/kindness">kindness</a> deleted.  Not really clear what this post is for, the post is heavily flagged by members for it not being clear what it's for, and so all we are left with a removal. 

Contacting member to hopefully figure out what the deal is while asking them to knock it off with <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/activity/337430/posts/meta/">what looks to be stunt posts.</a>
