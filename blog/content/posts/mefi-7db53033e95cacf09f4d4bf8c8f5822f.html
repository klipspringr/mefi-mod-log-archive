Please consider skipping a thread if all you have offer is disparaging comments about the subject and its fans.  MetaFilter is all about having conversation, so just posting about how you hate something doesn't help any discussion. It just derails it or stops it cold. 

Let people enjoy the things they like. Move on if you do not like it or at least add to the discussion by offering something more than "I hate  you". If you can't do that, we may have to remove your comments or yourself from the thread or site.</div>
