Calling everyone who believes in a certain point of view "murderers and complicit"  reduces the discussion to an emotional argument that no side can ever rise above or get past.

Disagreement is fine and welcomed on MetaFilter. Heading for the extremes is not. Let's try and find ways to disagree that don't paint the other as mortal enemies.
