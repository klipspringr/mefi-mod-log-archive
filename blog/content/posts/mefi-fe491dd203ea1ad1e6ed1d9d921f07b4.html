MetaFilter post <a href="//www.metafilter.com/100588/It-Rarely-Stops">"It Rarely Stops"</a> deleted.  Domestic violence is awful and this is an arresting and disturbing spot, but neither of those really seems to add up to a metafilter post.  I'm sure the intent was good but I'm not sure why this is here with this presentation. -- <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/7418">cortex</a>
