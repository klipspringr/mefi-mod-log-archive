<div><em> And unless I've misunderstood something, this is the one triad of people at all of Metafilter right now who owns it and has any actual power to make decisions.

FYI, there is now a link in the site navigation bar titled "<a href="https://faq.metafilter.com/358/general-info">Staff &amp; Site Info</a>" that links to a FAQ entry that has the staff box and general site information.  It's accessible from every page and if people have suggestions about other information that can go in there, please let us know in the comments or via the <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/contact/">Contact Us</a> page. </div>
