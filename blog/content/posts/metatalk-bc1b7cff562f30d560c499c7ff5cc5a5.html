<div><a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26657/A-MeFiCoFo-board-election-should-be-held-in-June#1443417">trig</a>: "<i>I MeMailed all three members a message that was put together with input and support from this thread. I know Rhaomi and Adam have been logging in to the site. Gorgik has not commented or posted since April. I also MeMailed him two weeks ago, to which he never responded.<br/>
<br/>
I'll MeMail you the message I sent him and would be grateful if you could pass it on to him. I prefer not to use email in communications with the board or mods.</i>"<br/>

Hi trig,<br/>
Thanks for your patience here, it's been a busy day at Mefi, so it's taken me a while to respond.<br/>
<br/>
I did MeMail Gorgik a message that people have questions about things and those questions are things only the Board can answer and linked him to your above comment. I'll also leave a note on Slack in the channel for the Board letting them know that members have questions and plans they'd like to discuss with the Board and that they've left MeMail messages at all three of their individual MeFi accounts. <br/>
<br/>
I would advise that concerns also be emailed to the Board at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3e735b78577d5178517e59535f5752105d5153"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="98d5fddef1dbf7def7d8fff5f9f1f4b6fbf7f5">[emailÂ protected]</span></a> as I believe that's the Board's preferred method of communication.<br/>
<br/>
None of this should be interpreted as me avoiding helping the community with their concerns. But as this is a Board matter, it's best that these concerns be directed to them and addressed by them to avoid any sort of miscommunication by involving a person in the middle.<br/>
<br/>
I'm happy to relay that members have questions and concerns that need to be answered and/or addressed by the Board and left a link to <a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26657/A-MeFiCoFo-board-election-should-be-held-in-June#1443417">your above comment</a> in the Board's Slack channel, <br/>
<br/>
Let me know if I can be of other assistance! </div>
