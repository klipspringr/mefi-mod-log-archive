<div><a href="https://www.metafilter.com/209560/Now-he-has-a-desk-in-a-sun-filled-room#8744795">seanmpuckett</a>: "<i>to be crystal clear, i am talking about violence, as applied to the apex capitalist class.</i>"

This is veering into going against <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/content_policy.mefi">MeFi's Content Policy</a> regarding advocating for violence, which states "It can be okay to talk in strongly critical terms about people's words but don't cross the line into any threats of violence or wishing violence on other people."

If folks could move on from those comments and back to the article itself, that would be great.
