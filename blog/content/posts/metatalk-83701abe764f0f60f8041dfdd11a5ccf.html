<div><a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26641/Multipart-post-series#1441105">Rash</a>: "<i>I don't set policy, but if I did these types of posts would not merely be allowed, but encouraged. (That is, if they aren't already.)</i>"<br/>
<br/>
The unwritten rule is that anything that doesn't cause a problem is fine. <br/>
<br/>
So if someone wanted to do a series of posts on how different types of paint dry on different types of materials that would be fine. <br/>
<br/>
Thinking about it as a I write this comment, a series of posts about a subject could also be a great way of teaching about a subject.  Say I wanted to do a post  about X, but there was a lot of information, too much for a single person to learn and put in a post. Breaking that learning up into several posts would be a good way to digest and share that information.  </div>
