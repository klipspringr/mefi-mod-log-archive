Hey, just fyi MetaFilter isn't a site for "you must see this now, it's very important" aggressive type comments or posts, nor is it encouraged to ask people to post something for you. In fact, if a person is feeling that something must posted and/or as soon as possible, we advise you rethink that that line of thought before posting.  

The comment was also off topic, meaning the thread is about AI/Sam Altman, but the comment was about Trump and the Smithsonian. Those two things aren't related.

So the comment has been deleted, for being a derail. Not a big deal, it's nothing personal! Just avoid posting offtopic comments in a thread, along with imploring others to make a post because you think it must be shared.</div>
