<br/>
This should not be happening and if anyone does see it happening, I am asking that you use the contact form to send an email that goes to every mod about and/or <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScd456dpbxpH7n-bKos12mlv5WQaTpJxwpWI9NUKLsaNb_LTA/viewform">report it to the Moderation Oversight Committee</a>. Again, this should absolutely not be happening and moderators should be called out if it does happen.<br/>

<br/>
Agreed, closing this thread up.</div>
