<div><a href="https://www.metafilter.com/208794/Private-Eye-salutes-best-investigative-reporting-of-the-year#8723751">Flitcraft</a>: "<i>Private Eye is notoriously transphobic and platforms transphobes...</i>"

This is true and transphobia is not something MetaFilter supports.

This particular post is about something positive, so in that light we're leaving the post up. We do think that highlighting good examples of journalism is important and good, but that the Private Eye publication is problematic on trans issues, and that is absolutely not ok. We leave it to individual members to be aware of Private Eye's transphobia and decide for themselves whether to click on the links. 

If members wish to discuss this issue further, they are welcome to create a post in MetaTalk to do so.</div>
