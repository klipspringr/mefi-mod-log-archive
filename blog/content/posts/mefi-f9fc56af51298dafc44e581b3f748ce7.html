<div>Robbyrobbs, take the week off for <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/209437/34-trillion-debt#8741189">the anti-trans link</a>. Do not do this again in any way shape or form on this site or you account will be removed.  MetaFilter is pro leaving trans folk alone and letting them live their lives, so knock it off. </div>
