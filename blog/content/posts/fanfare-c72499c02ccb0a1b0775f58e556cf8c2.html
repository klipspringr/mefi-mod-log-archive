<div>One comment removed for revealing how this season ends in discussion about the first episode.  <br/>
<br/>
Folks, please do not reveal things that happen in future episodes, even if all the episodes have been released. You can make  separate post/discussion about multiple episodes, but otherwise just keep discussion to the current or previous episodes.<br/>
<br/>
Axiom, if you're ok with mods removing that particular poiler paragraph from your comment and and letting the rest of it be live, let us know, that's totally an option.</div>
