<div><a href="https://www.metafilter.com/212020/power-energy-freedom#8808899">kadonoishi</a>: "<i>Imma sharply criticize the MeFi community right now by pointing out that, if you like Technology Connections's presentation, then you need to acknowledge that Elon Musk has been doing exactly this since he bought into Tesla in 2004, with the exact eventual purpose that TC laid out very ably in this video.</i>"

Hey, it's totally ok to leave Musk out of this thread since it's not about him or his company. There's plenty of other threads and places on the internet you can talk about him.

It's also ok and even preferred to refrain from lobbing accusations at the entire community. 

No comments have been removed, but please move on from that derail.
