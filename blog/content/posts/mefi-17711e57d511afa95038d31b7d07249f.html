<div> <em>***** Panorama team should be put up against a ******* wall and shot.</em>

The entire comment that contained this phrase has been removed, because while having a strong reason to anything is fine, <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/content_policy.mefi">MetaFilter's Content Policy</a> does draw the line at advocating for people to be killed or other threats and/or wishes of violence. 

Don't do that on this site.  </div>
