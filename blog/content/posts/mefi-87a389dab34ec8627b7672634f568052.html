MetaFilter post <a href="//www.metafilter.com/95665/Sickening">Sickening</a> deleted.  I feel like when a lot of the discussion in the thread is people acknowledging that they can't even stomach reading the central link, it might be something that good intentions aside just isn't a great idea for a post.  Awful, horrific situation but whether it makes sense for mefi is a fair question. -- <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/7418">cortex</a>
