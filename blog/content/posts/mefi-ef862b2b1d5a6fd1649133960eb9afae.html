toodleydoodley, the article is about Japan, yet you're consistently making arguments from a western perspective based on your western experiences. 

Please stop doing that and give the thread a break. For everyone else ready this, please leave the US, the west and other countries out of your comments. Again, the article is about Japan, so commenting as someone who doesn't live in the country or have a lot of experience with its culture in terms of religion and child abuse is speaking from a place of blind ignorance.

Some comments have been removed  based on the above rationale.</div>
