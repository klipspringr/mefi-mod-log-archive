<div><a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26642/Metafilter-is-at-risk-of-being-brigaded-by-bad-actors#1441832">mediareport</a>: "<i>It would be great if whatever MeTa post is made next week asking for candidates to declare would be highlighted in various ways by the mods - sidebar, posts at all subsites, banner, etc, as has been suggested multiple times in these threads - but if we have to do it without that help I'm sure we'll manage.</i>"<br/>

I'd advise <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/contact/">sending an email</a> when folks want things added to the nav, sidebar, or posts on subsites so that we're aware of when to do it and any relevant verbiage to include.  Yes to all these things.  </div>
