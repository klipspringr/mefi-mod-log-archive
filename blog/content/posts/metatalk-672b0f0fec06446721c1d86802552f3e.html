<div><a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26767/MetaFilter-General-Site-Update-September-2025#1450117">Brandon Blatcher</a>: "<i>Hey, just ran through some tests where I created a post for the FPP, Ask, Anon Ask, FanFare, and MeTa, that order. The system correctly posted the FPP, then has glitched where a message is posted saying an old post was deleted, but it wasn't wasn't. Have let frimble know about that, they'll look into it.</i>"<br/>
<br/>
Frimble has fixed this, deleted posts <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/recent-mod-actions.cfm">are showing up in the mod log</a> with their reason. Note that currently if the deletion reason is edited, a new entry appears in the log for the same post, which is ok, but I'd say it's fine in the sense of members being able to see everything that was done/edit differences.  </div>
