MetaFilter post <a href="//www.metafilter.com/150086/You-have-to-wrestle-with-the-accusations">"You have to wrestle with the accusations."</a> deleted.  This is a terrible thing that happened, but I'm not sure there's enough here to make it a conversation distinct from the many we've had on the subject. -- <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/28936" id="sig">restless_nomad</a>
