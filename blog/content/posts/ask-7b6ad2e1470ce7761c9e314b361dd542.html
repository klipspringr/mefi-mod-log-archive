Hey this link is broken and not sure what you meant to link to, <a href="https://www.leuchtturm1917.us/classic-notebooks-1.html">maybe this notebook</a> in the yellow? If not, let the mods know and we can update the original link. 

Edit: now that link is down, even though it was working a second ago! Bottom line, Leuchtturm1917 has notebook similar in color to what the OP was asking for. </div>
