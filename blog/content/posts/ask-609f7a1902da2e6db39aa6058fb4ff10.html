<div>Noting that the terms "transmale" and "transfemale" are considered problematic because these are medicalizing terms associated with Trans-Exclusionary views. The preferred the terms are "trans man/woman" or "transgender man/woman". I've reached out to the member in question and edited the comment with their permission.</div>
