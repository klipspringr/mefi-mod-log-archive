Changed the above paragraph in the post to this: <blockquote>Added a General Staff and Site Information FAQ that contains basic information that members have requested be in one place. The <a href="https://faq.metafilter.com/358/general-info">link to this FAQ entry</a> will be placed in the navigation bar for easy access and titled "Staff &amp; Site Info". If there's something you think should be added to it, please let us know in the comments!</blockquote> Done to make it clearer that the link contains information about the staff.<br/>
