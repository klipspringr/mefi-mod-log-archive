Obviously feel free to disagree with others, but insinuating that another member is AI or using AI is an insulting and unhelpful path to take, so please avoid doing that in the future. 

It's also ok to move on if other members don't want to discuss a particular take with you or explain themselves to your satisfaction or understanding. Please just move on, thanks. </div>
