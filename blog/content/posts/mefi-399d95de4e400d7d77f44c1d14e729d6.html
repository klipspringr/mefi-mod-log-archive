<div>Two comments from  bombastic lowercase boatshoes are being flagged, the second has been removed as wishing violence on other people goes against our <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/content_policy.mefi">guidelines</a>, so let's avoid proposing assassinations. That being said, there are  legitimate forms of protest that involve violence against property (just not against other people) so the first comment has been left up. </div>
