Ryvar, this is the type of comment, where you essentially call people stupid or easily manipulated, isn't conducive to discussion, so don't do that. 

You are not being forced to participate in these discussions obviously (no one is). So please consider whether your comments add anything to the discussion as name calling overrides any point you are trying to make and brings the level of discussion down.

Case in point:

<a href="https://www.metafilter.com/210125/I-Am-An-AI-Hater#8760496">TheWhiteSkull</a>: "<i>You know what, <strong>Ryvar</strong>? Having just re-read your last comment, particularly the bit about "truthiness," actually just fuck off.</i>"

Calling people names just devolves the conversation till it becomes about fighting or telling people to fuck off. Which MetaFilter actively discourages, so please knock it off, it usually just starts a fight or makes it worse.  

To everyone,  remember you're talking to people, so aim to be respectful, even in heated conversations or when disagreeing. It's ok to walk away from  a discussion that's turning ugly. </div>
