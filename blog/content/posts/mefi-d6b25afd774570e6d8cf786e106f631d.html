<div>Please remember that comments wishing harm on others go against our <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/content_policy.mefi">content policy</a>. I've removed a few comments for this reason and kept some that were borderline (continue flagging if you believe they should be deleted).

I've left the derail about Israel/US good/evil, but let's focus on sharing relevant news rather than targeting individual users in arguments.

Also, adrienneleigh, please consider taking a step back and allowing others to carry on with the thread.</div>
