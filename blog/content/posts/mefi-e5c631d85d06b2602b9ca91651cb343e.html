<div>june_dodecahedron, thanks for bringing this to our attention. In the future, please flag and then shoot us an email to get our attention in these situations. There's only one mod on duty and I am just now seeing the profile you've pointed out. 

Let's refocus this thread back to the topic it was intended for, as OP has requested. I can confirm that I'm bringing this up to the team right now and working on taking action. Feel free to shoot me an email if you have any other concerns. </div>
