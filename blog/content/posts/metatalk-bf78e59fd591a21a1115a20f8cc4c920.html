<div><a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26658/dont-post-AI-has-become-dont-post-about-AI#1443410">lookoutbelow</a>: "<i>FWIW I submitted a contact form request just now requesting input from site staff on the sidebar questions.<br/>
<br/>
If I can summarize:<br/>
Who writes it?<br/>
What is its purpose in the staff's view?<br/>
Why are there so many repetitive messages relating to AI?</i>"<br/>
<br/>
Hi there lookoutbelow, I'm responding to you here publicly instead of the email.<br/>
<br/>
The Best Of blog is solely written by me. Previously the purpose of it was share stuff the community generally seemed to like  or to share specific stuff that had been flagged as fantastic. The current focus, as defined by me, is exploring  how  the blog (or the writings) could potentially be used entice or encourage non members to sign up for the site.<br/>
<br/>
To that end, I've been focusing on what sort of value or interest the site would have non members. Being non AI, where all the comments are written by people seems like a good thing to highlight. But yeah, it may be a bit heavy handed as i'm not great at writing sales copy, so it's been a bit of learning experience. Will probably tone it down a bit and see what sort of measuring of stats can/should be done of those posts and the blog and whether the site should be doing more social media and if so, how to do it. <br/>
<br/>
But first, I wanted to see how I cope with writing this style of copy amidst other duties before seeking suggestions/help. <br/>
