<div><em>What steps are you taking towards that?</em><br/>
– We've moved from this being a one person effort to a team effort and set timelines/owners for each section of the site update.<br/>
– I'm working with the board to set better communication channels for volunteers, the board and the staff.<br/>
– Brandon and I discussed just yesterday the possibility of breaking the site update into different posts (tech updates, admin updates, moderation updates, etc..) that way once section won't hold the other. <br/>
