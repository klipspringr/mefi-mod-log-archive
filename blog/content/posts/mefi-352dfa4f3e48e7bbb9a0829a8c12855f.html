Just following up on this comment and what other members have pointed out: Painting Jewish people as a monolithic block is anti-semitic. Not all Jews agree with the Israeli government. Not all Jews support various actions of the Israeli military. 

Anyone who said all blacks agree with "X" would be quickly condemned as racist, so please be cognizant of your thoughts and language when speaking of the Jewish people.
