<div><em>I did consider making a MeTa post that was literally just "who is in charge here"</em><br/>
<br/>
Slight update to the <a href="https://faq.metafilter.com/358/general-info">General Info FAQ</a> which clarifies the position of the Interim Board (IB) members, and clarifies that loup is in a position over all the moderators.<br/>
<br/>
But for      quick reference, here's the Board info:<br/>
Rhaomi: President<br/>
1Adam12: Treasurer<br/>
Gorgik: Secretary </div>
