Hi, friendly reminder that there is a list of tags/keywords for every post, located on the right side of the post on desktop or at the bottom of the page on mobile. 

Granted, that's not easy to find on mobile, especially for this particular post, but it IS there, if people are wondering what a post is about. 

Remember, folks don't have to read, enjoy, or understand every single post. It's perfectly fine and even encouraged to just close the tab or window if you don't like or understand a post and move on to another one.  </div>
