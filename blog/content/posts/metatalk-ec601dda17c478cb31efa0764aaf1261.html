<div><em>...now I'm thinking maybe I should leave, after setting this burst off.<br/>
<br/>
I've got some thinking to do.</em><br/>
<br/>
A lot of members have had positive reactions to what you're posting and the mod team has already spoken about "yeah, keep an eye out for her posts to make sure things don't go off rails 'cause of the bigots." <br/>
<br/>
Ultimately it's up to you and do whatever feels right for you, but your presence and posts have had a positive affect. You're posting for good reasons with good intentions, just remember that you're not responsible for ugly reactions that bigots might have to your posts or comments.<br/>
<br/>
Also, don't feel as though you  <em>have</em> to post every week, that can feel like burden and/or lessen the joy.  </div>
