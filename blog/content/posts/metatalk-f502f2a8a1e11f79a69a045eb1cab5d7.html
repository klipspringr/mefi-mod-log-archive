<div>Ok, have signed MetaFilter.com  with <a href="https://uptimerobot.com/">UptimeRobot</a> to monitor the site. It's the free version, checks the site every five minutes and if it's down, will send an email to the mod email, which all the mods can see.<br/>
<br/>
Told the rest of the staff about this on Slack and posted the account login info to the mod slack, so that any staff member will be able to login to UptimeRobot. Have pinned that and the BlueSky account info in a channel on the mod Slack for easy reference. <br/>
<br/>
This isn't a perfect solution, just a halfway decent option as staff discusses ways to be alerted when the site is down, so that the community can be notified that we're aware and working on it. <br/>

Apparently that solution didn't work this time?</i>"<br/>
