<div> <a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26723/Declining-Stats#1447177">ashbury</a>: "<i>Why is MetaTalk so lightly moderated? Why does this policy, such as it, exist? Does it have to exist the way it currently is used? Can't it change? Why hasn't a mod stepped in here to tell everybody to cool it?<br/>
<br/>
I'm not just shouting these question into the void - these are real questions and I would actually like some answers from a mod.</i>"<br/>
<br/>
MetaTalk has a long tradition of being lightly moderated, with the belief it's the place for members to say exactly what they want. I think this policy and MeTa were put in place to give members a place on the site to truly vent as opposed to doing so in threads on the front page or Ask.<br/>
<br/>
I believe we talked briefly in a past MeTa about moderating this subsite more like the main site and at the time people were heavily against it is my recollection. But there's no reason why things can't change and if someone wants to make a new MeTa about that, go for it. Talking about it here at the bottom of a thread with a different subject (declining stats) probably won't get as many eyeballs. </div>
