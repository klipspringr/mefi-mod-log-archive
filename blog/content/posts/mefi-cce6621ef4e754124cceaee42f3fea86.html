xdvesper, go ahead and remove yourself from this thread. The subject is about shifting views of the Israeli government as they continue to commit genocide in Gaza. Coming in here to essentially say "no Israel is right" is not ok. 

No comments deleted at this point, but there's no need for you to continue in this thread, so please move on.</div>
