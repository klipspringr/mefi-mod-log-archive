<div>1,500 ft. 

That's how low the airplane is when they first encounter Hugo. None of the crew or staff was keen about that height, but they figured they'd give it a try and if didn't work, they'd go up to 5,000 ft. That definitely takes guts. 

I'm only on the second page and it's already a suspenseful read. Thanks for finding and sharing this ShooBoo! </div>
