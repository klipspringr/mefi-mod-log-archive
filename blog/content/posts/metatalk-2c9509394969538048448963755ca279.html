<div><em>What does 'promoting piracy' mean in that context? </em><br/>
<em> Can you explain to me how saying "I went back to pirating" is "allow[ing] it on the site"?</em><br/>
<br/>
Posting a comment that says "Honestly I just canceled everything and started pirating again", <a href="https://ask.metafilter.com/387890/First-you-pay-and-then-you-pay-some-more-streaming-TV#5496419">having that deleted and asked to not promote piracy</a>, then posting a second comment that says <a href="https://ask.metafilter.com/387890/First-you-pay-and-then-you-pay-some-more-streaming-TV#5496635">"You should just pirate"</a> is the line we're drawing here. Don't explicitly suggest/tell/advise others to pirate stuff and don't announce that you're pirating. <br/>
<br/>
'Cause while the chances of the site being investigated for promoting piracy are small, we think it's a good idea to make those chances even smaller by having members avoid advocating piracy. </div>
