After this obituary post was created and numerous positive comments were made, <a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26638/In-celebration-of-chrismear#1440932">allegations of off-site abuse were made about the deceased</a>. Those allegations were deemed credible, which eventually resulted in deletion of this thread.

No part of MetaFilter was used in off-site abuse. 

Multiple members requested that their comments be removed from the thread after the allegations were made and those requests were done.
