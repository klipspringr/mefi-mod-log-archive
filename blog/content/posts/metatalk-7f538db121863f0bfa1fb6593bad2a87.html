<div><a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26723/Declining-Stats#1447141">kittens for breakfast</a>: "<i>I'm sure Jacqueline is a very nice person and I am sorry that she buttoned; however, it is my belief that someone who would button over what I said was of a mind to leave the site regardless.</i>"<br/>

Yeah and that's the point. People are stressed in general these daysand may have other things going on in their  lives  and someone's comment on the site comes off as an attack might be their final straw. Sure, it wasn't intended, but that's besides the point now. It's been said and regardless of intention feelings were hurt.<br/>

We could all do with taking a moment to breath and consider what we want to do with our comments on the site. Because like it or not, they can hurt or come off the wrong way, even when someone doesn't mean them to and that just adds more anger to a situation.<br/>
<br/>
We could all use less anger in our lives and on the site.  </div>
