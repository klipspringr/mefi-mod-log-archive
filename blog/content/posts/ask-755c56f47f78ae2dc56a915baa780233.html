<div>Hi folks, just a mod note to recommend that people be gentler with those in abusive situations. We know the intention is good, but to those within the situation, the forceful, authoritative tone can feel like a further erosion of their agency and cause the person to shut down or ignore the suggestions, even if they are helpful. Please try to moderate your tone for the person who really needs the help.<br/>
