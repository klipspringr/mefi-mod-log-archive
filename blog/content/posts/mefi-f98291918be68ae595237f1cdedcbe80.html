<div>Yikes! One comment against the <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/content_policy.mefi">Content Policy</a> deleted. rough ashlar has now been warned and banned for a week. Also, the subsequent comments have been deleted to avoid derails. Let's be clear, MeFi is not the place to echo common anti-transgender talking points and make inflammatory generalizations about a vulnerable group. This is potentially harmful rhetoric and will not be tolerated here.  </div>
