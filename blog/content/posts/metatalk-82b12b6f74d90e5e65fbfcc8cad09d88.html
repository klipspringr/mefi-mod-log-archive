<div><em>I guess I am behind the times? Is editorializing ok now?</em><br/>
<br/>
No, editorializing is not ok now. This particular post fell into a grey area, so we left it up under the guideline of "let people talk about what they want to talk about in almost every case" and kept an eye on it. The discussion was basically fine.<br/>
<br/>
Others have already chimed in various suggestions or point, so no need to rehash them. Basically, post about stuff that interests you, the links should stand on their own, and avoid making a post about you or your thoughts/feelings on the subject. <br/>
