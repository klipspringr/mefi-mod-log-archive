<div><small>[Mod notes about this post and the general topic:<br/>
<br/>
Yes, there is currently still a MetaTalk queue, but it's in name only, everything is being approved as soon as possible. The queue has been operating that way for several weeks. This week we'll cut the final technical chord so there will be no queue at all. A MeTa post will be posted about that on Tuesday.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, please be kind to each other. The world is mess at the moment and there's no easy fixes coming anytime soon. MetaFilter in general can be place to talk about all sorts of things, but the conversation is only as good as we all make it.<br/>
<br/>
Post about things that interest you, single links are fine, as well as pages of multi links, have at it. No one is under any obligation to please everyone with what they posts (and its not possible anyway), so just have at it. The community will deal with fallout from particular subjects if need be.<br/>
<br/>
If you see a post you don't like or care for, just move on from it or engage with it thoughtfully. Use <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/home/mymefi">MyMefi</a> and <a href="https://ask.metafilter.com/home/myask">My Ask</a> to filter what you want and don't want see. <br/>
<br/>
Finally, mods <em>can</em> close posts on MetaTalk (and only on MetaTalk) so that's an option if people believe the way this is framed isn't helpful. <br/>
<br/>
Otherwise take it easy and remember that the site is only as fun and interesting as we collectively make it.  ]</small> </div>
