<div> One comment removed and account deleted due to the account being an obvious troll one that targeted a specific member and dragged off site happenings onto MetaFilter.<br/>
<br/>
It should be noted that the troll account was directed at me as a mod and that I'm currently the mod on duty. After consulting with the new board they were in agreement that the comment and account should be removed because there was no need for it be left around for a different mod to deal with.<br/>
