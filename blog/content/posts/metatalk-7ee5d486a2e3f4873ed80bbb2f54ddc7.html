<div>If Violet Blue, or anyone else, wants to create a MeTa about anti semitism on MetaFilter and how to reduce it, that's totally fine, go for it. I recommend avoiding making it personal and please avoid trying to police the thread and arguing with everyone who disagrees with your (general your, not a specific person) point of view.<br/>
<br/>
This thread should stick to discussion about moderation and the MeTa queue.<br/>
