This entire comment has been removed for the moment while I talk it over with other mods and the current board. 

The comment was by one member, who was drawing a line in the sand not only for themselves, but tof the entire site as what could and would be said Charlie Kirk. That's a personal choice and as I see it, pending talking with other mods and the current board, not the sort of comment we should just leave up at the moment.

nobody_truncates and other members, please refrain from these types of comments until we can decide as a site if and how we wish to host them, and if so, how to handle potential demands that we remove such comments. In the meantime such comments will be removed.

Thanks for everyone's patience as we figure things out. </div>
