<div><em>[Positively] Is the link to "collecting information about member run activities and events" supposed to go here?</em><br/>
<br/>
Yep, fixed now, thanks for pointing out!<br/>
<br/>
<em> Curious why Seattle was selected for the P.O. Box location and how that will work with a board-run site.</em><br/>
<br/>
One of the board members lives there, so it's easy for them to pick it up.<br/>
<br/>
Also added a link to the MefiQuote announcement page.  </div>
