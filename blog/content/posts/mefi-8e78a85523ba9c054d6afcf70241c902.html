<div>Hello, MetaFilter moderation staff here. Do not come into this post or anywhere on MetaFilter to gloat about transphobia or be transphobic in any way, shape, or form. The accounts for bluemat and Czjewel  have now been permanently banned for doing so. 

The moderation staff of MetaFilter intends to be more aggressive about dealing with transphobia on the site and much quicker than previously to redirect conversations and assign bans. 

If you're not sure what transphobia means or is, you're welcome to reach out to the mods with questions. Otherwise, if you're not sure about whether a comment you want to make is transphobic it's perfectly fine to not say anything and just read a thread and learn something.  </div>
