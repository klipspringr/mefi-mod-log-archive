Ask MetaFilter post <a href="//ask.metafilter.com/388107/Richard-Smith-English-Guitarist">Richard Smith (English Guitarist)</a> deleted.  Sorry to hear that anyone is having trouble, but MeFi doesn't allow links to GoFundMe or other active charities on the site. Should you wish to post this question again, it's advised to leave out the parts about Richard Smith or the fundraiser, as it has little to do with question you're asking.
