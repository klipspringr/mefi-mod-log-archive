<div> Added tne 'uspolitics' tag added.

Several comments removed for pointedly calling out other members for their comments and making it person. Stop making moral pronouncements of other members because they have a different take, that does absolutely nothing for the conversation.

Otherwise, as a political figure, Joe Biden invokes a lot of various feelings and that's understable. 

But please stop arguing with each other about who's right and who has the best take on him and who's morally wrong for their take, as that doesn't create or sustain any sort of constructive discussion.</div>
