<div><a href="https://www.metafilter.com/209075/Can-the-humble-ferry-go-all-electric#8730915">BCMagee</a>: "<i>I just hope Trump never gets lured onto one of these, and if so that it doesn't ply a route through shark-rich waters, and if so that the ferry doesn't spring a small, non-buoyancy-threatening leak near the battery compartment.
