<div>One comment removed for doubling down on saying "fuck you" to another member. That rule is pretty straightforward, please do not double down on breaking it. 

Another comment removed for pulling information from a user's profile into the thread and demanding a user be banned. 

 june_dodecahedron, you absolutely need to chill on these types of derails in this thread. You're welcome to take it to MetaTalk or email the mods. Your anger is understandable and the mods are your side, but please avoid continuing to derail the original thread. </div>
