<div>Just coming to clarify because <a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26800/MeFiCoFo-Board-Update-Oct-25-2025#1451349">this comment</a> is getting flagged: Actually, saying "fuck someone" does fall under the "Be considerate and respectful" section of the <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/guidelines.mefi">guidelines</a> and the "Name calling" section of the <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/content_policy.mefi">content policy</a>.<br/>
However, this is also why we maintain lighter moderation on MteaTalk; it's the place where you can voice concerns, frustrations, and disagreements freely. So while this does technically go against our guidelines, we're probably not going to delete it.<br/>
That said, we do hope members can keep in mind that the people being called out here are fellow community members volunteering their time to help. </div>
