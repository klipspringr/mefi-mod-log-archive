<div>Hey, it's Brandon again, going to respond to questions about the simple mod log by first explaining how it came to be:<br/>
<br/>
Me: hey, we should do the mod log that members have been asking for<br/>
Management (MM): we don't really have the resources to do that<br/>
Me: well, members are distrustful, so it would be good to show them that there isn't anything weird going on.<br/>
MM: yeah, but we don't have the resources<br/>
<br/>
This occurs a few times until I the internal tracker we used is kinda like a log.<br/>
<br/>
Me: Hey this tracker we use kinda works like a mod log, can we repurpose that to be a mod log? That way we're not starting from scratch and just adjusting a few things. <br/>
MM: ok, we can do that.<br/>
<br/>
Some time passes due to frimble getting in an accident and being unable to work for a bit, then the transition happens and other things are made priority, coding wise.<br/>
<br/>
Me: soooo, about the mod log?<br/>
MM: yep, we're finishing it up, here's an admin only look at it for now. we're not going to flesh it out, as resources are focused on developing the new site. <br/>
<br/>
Me: hey members, here's a simple moderation log (SML)!<br/>
Members: Ok, cool, but why isn't this more full featured?!<br/>
Me: Focusing resources on new site. <br/>
<br/>
Me thinking to myself: This could be more full featured and a lot of members will be disappointed and want more, which makes total sense, but this is at least at start and we can go from there.<br/>
<br/>
For the record, I'm 100% behind doing a full featured moderation log. <a href="https://lobste.rs/moderations">The one at lobster.rs</a> has been mentioned a few times and I think that's a great goal to shoot for, with a few MeFi tweaks. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<em>...but I do wonder why the log isnâ€™t an archive...<br/>
<br/>
Why only 50 comments and why only the last 7 days?</em><br/>
<br/>
Unknown, my guess is that it was the simplest or easiest thing to do or queries the database the least, but I honestly don't know. Have posted that question on the Slack.<br/>
