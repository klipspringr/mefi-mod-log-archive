Screenshots of the error would be best, but lacking that,  a note would be fine, be it email or a MeTa post, just so we can tell if something is going on for a lot of people or just a few.  I don't see an error recorded for the glitches you mention paduasoy.<br/>

But I am currently  just using the free version UptimeRobot, the paid version of Cloudflare no doubt has more robust monitoring. I don't have access to that yet, frimble is working on getting me access, not current eta on that.</div>
