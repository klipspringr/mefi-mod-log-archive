MetaFilter post <a href="//www.metafilter.com/211681/Do-Androids-Dream-of-Epstein-Island">Do Androids Dream of Epstein Island?</a> deleted.  The post is on a controversial topic, but it's not exactly clear what the topic is, most of the links are too gated articles, and the inside portion has an editorial slant that geared towards making people angry, hence the deletion of this specific post.

Another post about the subject would be fine, but please post ungated links, consider a trigger warning, and avoid defining the post in the comments.
