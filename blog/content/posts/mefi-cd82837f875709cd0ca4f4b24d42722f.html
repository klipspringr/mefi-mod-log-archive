MetaFilter post <a href="//www.metafilter.com/211598/Where-is-Edward-Snowden-now-when-we-need-him">Where is Edward Snowden now (when we need him)?</a> deleted.  Hi there! This looks like it would be better to post in <a href="https://ask.metafilter.com/">Ask MetaFilter</a>, as it's an actual question as opposed to linking to something interesting on the web.
