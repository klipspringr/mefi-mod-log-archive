<div>There are excellent questions about who should be able to add tags to a post in regards to the USpolitics tag. Currently it's possible for the original poster, a mod, or someone with a connection to the poster to add any tag to a post, just fyi.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously the current system is imperfect and may need to be rebuilt. Particularly if people want to block a tag, does that mean any post with that tag is blocked? Or is there another way of blocking posts that are tagged by other people that will deliver a high level of success? <br/>
<br/>
Currently there's request, via a flag, for the USpolitics tag to be added to  this post, <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/209603/If-this-isnt-infringement-Congress-needs-to-do-something">https://www.metafilter.com/209603/If-this-isnt-infringement-Congress-needs-to-do-something</a>,  which I think is a reasonable request. But I've gone ahead and asked the original poster if they're cool with that. What do y'all think? <br/>
<br/>
If they aren't and say no, is that a good system for the USpolitics tag with our current system. Should one person get to decide for everyone else about what is blocked under USpolitics?  </div>
