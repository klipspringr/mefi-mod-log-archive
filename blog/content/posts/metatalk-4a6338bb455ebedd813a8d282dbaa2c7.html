<div><em> Brandon: what happened to Violet Blue's MeTa thread?</em><br/>
<br/>
Please create a MeTa for that and cease derailing this one.  I'm up for a little bit, so it should go through. Yes, people may think it's ridiculous, to create a MeTa about why another MeTa wasn't published, but folks need to stop derailing this post.<br/>
<br/>
I'm up for a while longer, so will send it through. </div>
