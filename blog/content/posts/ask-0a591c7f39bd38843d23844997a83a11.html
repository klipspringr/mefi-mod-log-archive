<div>One comment removed due to simply writing "Lots of opinions on this". <br/>
<br/>
The way AskMe works is that people ask concrete question and get (hopefully) concrete answers or suggestions about a problem they're having. Writing "lots of opinions on this" does not help the OP by offering any actual advice or solution, it's just a vague opinion. It's true, sure, people do have various opinions about the question, but that's not the sort of answer we want to encourage on AskMe.  <br/>
<br/>
So please try to help the OP by sharing your knowledge or information about the specific question they're having, thanks!</div>
