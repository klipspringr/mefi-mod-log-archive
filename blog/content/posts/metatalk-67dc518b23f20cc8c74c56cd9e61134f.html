<div><a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26650/MetaFilter-Moderation-Oversight-Committee-Send-your-concerns-our-way#1442436">trig</a>: "<i>Looking at the footer, I see "Moderation Review" but I don't think that's very self-explanatory. Maybe a caption like "Got a concern about moderation?" would help - similar styling as the "Join 8,311 readers..." caption under "Fund Metafilter". And I'd also put a link to the form in the Contact Us page. (To be honest, a prominent link there might be enough to make the footer link redundant, but then again redundancy's fine.)</i>"<br/>
