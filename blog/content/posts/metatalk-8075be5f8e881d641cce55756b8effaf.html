<div>Hi, Brandon the mod chiming in.<br/>
<br/>
ChatGPT is a contentious subject and that's mostly wants going in here, IMO. Some people loathe the topic and don't want to see any more about, while others want to talk about it a lot because it is so impactful on society.<br/>
<br/>
So everyone please be mindful if you're making a post about AI/ChatGPT. Making the posts is fine, it's not a taboo subject. Sometimes people want to talk or share about something that's interesting, but MeFilter isn't occurring in an abstract discussion in a class. Real people are being affected by this technology and there's a lot of negative thoughts and feelings about it. <br/>
<br/>
That's no excuse for members to be posting derailing or abusive comments. If the comments are derailing/abusive/attacking please flag them as such, so mods can take a look. Not everyone has to like or agree with the subject or premise of a post and it's fine to chime in with criticism or disagree, but keep in constructive and focused on the subject of the post. Mods might leave notes and remove content if that's derailing the post.<br/>
<br/>
Clearly us mods could have done a better job in this instance, mostly due to the it being the weekend and less coverage. I'll go through the threads to see if anything needs to be removed or notes left, that'll be an ongoing process through the night, so bear with me there.  </div>
