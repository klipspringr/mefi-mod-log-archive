<div>Hi, I'd like to do a test of the anon queue and am requesting ONE person respond to this comment. Then that SINGLE person will go and create ONE anon AskMe labeled TEST and in the text of the question will post the time they submitted it and what time zone they'rei n.  That test anon question will be approved and then quickly removed and we'll see what happens. <br/>
<br/>
Basically, I'm pretty sure we can approve anon questions whenever, but want to test that assumption.  </div>
