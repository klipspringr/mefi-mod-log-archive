<div>DeepSeaHaggis, you've asked your question, members will respond if they choose to. There's no need to keep pushing.

Now, the article appears to be largely or entirely AI-generated, which technically falls within our <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/content_policy.mefi">content policy</a> and <a href="https://faq.metafilter.com/348/chatgpt">the FAQ's etiquette</a>. Since the thread is going mostly well and the topic itself concerns AI, we're allowing this thread to continue.

 If you would want to discuss this particular stance about AI generated content feel free to open a MetaTalk post about it, we are open to refine our policies and, frankly will need to keep updating them as this technology develops and becomes more pervasive. </div>
