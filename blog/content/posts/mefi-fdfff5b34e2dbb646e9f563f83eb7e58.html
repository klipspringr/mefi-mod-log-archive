<div> OP, i'd recommend changing the leading paragraph to the one from the article:
"Labor Day for me has always symbolized the importance of elevating the fight for gender equality in the work place, and also behind the camera. Here is a list of our top 25 films that show that, and where to watch them." Just so it's clearer what the link is about. </div>
