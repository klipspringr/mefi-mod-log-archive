<br/>
Hey, just a note to say things are being worked on in terms of the financial reports, but I don't know when information will be finalized and shared. The board is handling all that and it's clear they'll respond when they're ready and able. <br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, yeah it sucks to have wait on all this, but it is what it is at the moment. <br/>
<br/>
Next general site update will be out the last week of May, by the 30th.   </div>
