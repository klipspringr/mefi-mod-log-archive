The original comment has been removed, 'cause arguing for eugenics has racist background and has largely been discredited. Responses to this comment have been left as a reminder that this type of advocacy is not wanted or welcomed on MetaFilter. 

Enturbulated, please take a break from the thread and if you return, cease the advocacy of eugenics. </div>
