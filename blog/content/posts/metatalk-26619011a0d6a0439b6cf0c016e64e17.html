<div><a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26699/USPolitics-tag-added-but-why#1445493">jacquilynne</a>: "<i>Brandon reached out for more details on the specific posts I thought were a problem, so I assume they are at least considering a change in calibration, but I don't know if or when more details will be forthcoming.</i>"<br/>
<br/>
Loup and I  talked about the situation earlier today (I've been off a few days, thanks for your patience). The simple solution is for mods not to add the USPolitics tag unless it is specifically requested. But there will still be disagreements about what is political. <br/>
<br/>
Hence the recommendation to occasionally look under a tag you've blocked, as tags are entirely user driven, so there's  going to be some disagreement at times about how to tag something.<br/>
<br/>
Folks can ask us to tag a post with a particular tag via email or flagging with a note. <br/>
<br/>
Please note that the sidebar of USPolitics is not tag driven. A mod has to go into the post and click a checkmark button that then adds it to the sidebar. That might be a better way of handling things, aka mods putting what they or other users suggest as USPolitics without tagging the post itself. But people might get upset about their post being added to that, so it's still going to be grey area where people have different opinions. <br/>
<br/>
We'll see how things go in terms of mods not tagging posts as USPolitics unless requested and see if we need to adjust anything on our end. </div>
