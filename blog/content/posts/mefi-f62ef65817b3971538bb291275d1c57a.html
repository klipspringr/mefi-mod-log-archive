<div><a href="https://www.metafilter.com/209194/Democratic-Minnesota-Lawmakers-Shot-in-Their-Homes#8734211">sotonohito</a>: "<i>So pigs hiding their faces and refusing to identify themselves has resulted in a person dressing up like a pig to murder Democratic lawmakers. I assume for the pigs that's a mission accomplished moment?</i>"

Just noting that we've received several flags about this comment and its use of  "pigs" to refer to cops. Doing that doesn't violate guidelines, so we're leaving the comment up and as is. 

That should not construed as agreement  with the use of the term pigs, just that members have a wide latitude in their choice of language. </div>
