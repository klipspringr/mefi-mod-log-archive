<div> CyberSlug Labs, take the week off while the moderation team discusses your comments. 

In the meantime, it is suggested that you seriously rethink your participation on the site, your comments were transphobic because they blamed child predators and social media for creating trans people. Completely unacceptable.

This note has been emailed to CyberSlug Labs.</div>
