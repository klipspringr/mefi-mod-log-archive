This should be something easily remedied during the next mod's next shift, and I'm expecting it to happen quickly, since the voting period has now begun. Thanks.</i>"<br/>
<br/>
Your request has been sent to the Election Committee, who have to approve any changes. Then the changes will be communicated to frimble, who is the only one who has access to edit the  particular page. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your patience. <br/>
