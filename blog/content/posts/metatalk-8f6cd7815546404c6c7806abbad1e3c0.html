Please don't do this, it can be considered dismissive of the post and your fellow member.<br/>
<br/>
It's totally fine to  comment that that  you're confused by a MeTa post and ask for clarification. It's also fine to just skip the post and not leave any comments. <br/>
<br/>
But don't try to shutdown or dismiss concerns that people might have by posting recipes. No one wants their thoughts or concerns to be dismissed or ignored, so please don't do it to others. </div>
