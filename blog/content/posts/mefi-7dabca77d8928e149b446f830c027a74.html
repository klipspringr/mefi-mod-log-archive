<div>Noting the flags on this post with AI generated content. Leaving it up for now, because there's no rule or guideline against a post that has AI content, <a href="https://faq.metafilter.com/#348">the only rule we have applies to comments</a>. 
That said, it would be best if anyone does make a post with AI content that it be tagged "AIcontent" (which I've now added to this post) so that people can use <a href="https://faq.metafilter.com/255/what-are-My-Mefi-My-Ask">MyMeFi</a> to filter out posts tagged as such. 

All that said, if people that wish to talk about whether AI content should be posted to MetaFilter at all, feel free to create a MetaTalk post for the community to discuss. 

That discussion should not be had in this post, and comments attempting to do so will be removed. </div>
