<div> Another comment removed for trying to argue when it's ok to bring up the USA in threads that are not about the USA.

There's a long history on MeFi about the USA being injected or brought up in threads where it's not mentioned or the subject of the thread.

You'd like to comment in this thread, please make it about India and its ban of online gambling apps. Folks are welcome to agree or disagree about this new law, but please make it India related.</div>
