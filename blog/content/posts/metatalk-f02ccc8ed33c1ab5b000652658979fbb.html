<br/>
Post appears in queue and stays there for 48 hours. From landing page of the backend, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/03ToTCm">mods can see the number of posts in the Anon and other queues</a> (no there is not a MeTa queue, the text was just left there, all MeTas are immediately posted). <br/>
<br/>
After 48 hours (i think), the grey circle turns Green, letting us know to manually approve an Anon post. <br/>
<br/>
After a certain amount of unknown time, the circle can red, letting us know a post is overdue. </div>
