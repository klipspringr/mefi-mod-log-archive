<div><a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26779/MetaFilter-site-rebuild-monthly-update-October-2025#1449981">According to Brandon Blatcher</a>, all anonymous AskMes are automatically delayed at least 48 hours. <br/>
<br/>
There's an update to this, I was incorrect. <br/>
<br/>
I wait for the <a href="https://imgur.com/a/03ToTCm">queue button</a> to turn green (<a href="https://imgur.com/a/qm6T1JQ">as demonstrated here</a>)before checking and approving anon AskMe's. That button turns green after 22 hours (created a test post to verify this).<br/>
<br/>
So the Anon AskMe's are not automatically delayed for 48 hours.  They do sit in a queue for 22 hours before the system "green lights" them for a mod to review and post. But the posts can be reviewed and published at any time once they're in the Anon queue.<br/>
<br/>
The queue button turns red after 48 hours, I think, still testing this part (will know this evening around 8pm ET). I've only seen the red button once or twice, when we were checking with other mods about a problematic post, so it did sit for a while. <br/>
<br/>
Apologies for confusion, hope this clarifies things</div>
