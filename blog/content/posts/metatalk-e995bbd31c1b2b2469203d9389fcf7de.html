<br/>
It's neat and interesting, but It can be difficult at times, of course, but any job can be. From waiting tables to graphic design freelancing to delivering mail to MeFi mod, people can be brutal with their comments, or as I like to say "The people are definitely peopling today". In these instances it's best to focus on what the actual problem or request and deal with that, as opposed to negative attitudes. It's the other person's choice to be how they are and isn't a reflection on me.. <br/>
<br/>
But for MeFi, I do think having mods spend a lot or even most of their time in MeTaTalk isn't great and ideally they'd be spending more time on other parts of the site, encouraging more conversations in the various posts. I described the job as a "facilitator of fun" during one conversation with the interim board and I like that idea.  </div>
