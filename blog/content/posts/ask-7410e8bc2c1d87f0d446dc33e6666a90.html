<div> Mod note: Yes, there are a lot of problematic things in this post. But the OP is seeking help and wants to do better, so please focus on those aspects of the question, particularly this bit: <blockquote>"Where are free places I can go to confidentially share this and start support now to address my own misogynistic behaviour and be the positive male role model when others won't." </blockquote></div>
