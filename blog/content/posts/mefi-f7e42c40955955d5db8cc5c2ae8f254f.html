This sounds like you're advocating for some sort of forced removal, which is not ok at all on MetaFilter. <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/208707/The-People-v-Donald-Trump#8721372">Sotonohito has addressed that line of thought</a>, so we're letting the original comment stay, but avoid posting those types of comments in the future, or we may have to remove the content and/or issue a ban. 

MetaFilter is not the place to be posting comments about how it's ok to remove any percentage of a population. If that's not what you meant to write, please clarify your statement and be careful what  you write in the future on MetaFilter. </div>
