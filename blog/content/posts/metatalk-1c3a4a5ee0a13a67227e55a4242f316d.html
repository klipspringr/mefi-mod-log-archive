<div><a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26650/MetaFilter-Moderation-Oversight-Committee-Send-your-concerns-our-way#1442412">It is regrettable that</a>: "<i>I'm sorry for not being up on the discussion surrounding this, but is it intended to be a permanent part of the header, or is that just to bring initial attention to it, and eventually it'll move somewhere else, say to a menu, or the footer?</i>"<br/>
<br/>
The link to request a Moderation Review is already in the footer! It's on the right side, under the Contact Us link, where it'll remain for the future, pending the site redesign or a request from the Moderation Oversight Committee to move it. <br/>
<br/>
 We'll leave the link in the nav bar for a few more days for higher visibility, then remove it from the there. </div>
