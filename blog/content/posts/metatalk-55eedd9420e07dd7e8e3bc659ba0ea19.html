<div><a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26627/Metafilter-Slowness-Unavailability#1441224">tivalasvegas</a>: "<i>So, here's the thing. This sounds like a great idea. I'm all for it. BUT. Is this a priority?</i>"<br/>
<br/>
I believe you were just making it point with this example, but just want to make it clear that no one is making this a priority (being able to link serial posts or doing it manually for tinyfryingpan). It was just a neat idea adn Kirkaracha is probably just throwing it on a list.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, the site update will be out next week, we're aiming for May 29th and hoping (fingers and toes crossed) to include the financial info in it. <br/>
<br/>
No absolute promises because I'm not involved in correcting, checking, or finalizing the info (and thus can't speak to specifics), but people are working and hoping to finish this project.  </div>
