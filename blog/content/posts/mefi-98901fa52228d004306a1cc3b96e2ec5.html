<div><a href="https://www.metafilter.com/210018/How-to-save-your-job-if-youre-a-billionaire-who-fails-to-deliver#8757384">straw</a>: "<i>I have been saying for a while that the problem with people who blindly believe that the current crop of chatbots portending AI being "right around the corner" don't have enough interactions with developmentally disabled adults. That willingness to tell you "yes", the infodumping on things they've read or otherwise imbibed from their environment that's almost plausible, but absolute bullshit? These are patterns that anyone who's spent time in a group home, or around programs for those with developmental delays, or just hanging out with DD relatives, picks up on real fast.

Hi, please be careful about you categorize and write about other people. While I don't think you met this comment to be dismissive of people that are developmentally disabled, the comment did pick up a number of flags that very understandably took it that, so heads about writing about others: be respectful and avoid using them (whoever they are) are examples to prove a point of yours. Because you may be ruining your own point be unknowingly being offensive.  </div>
