<div><a href="https://ask.metafilter.com/387648/Non-prescription-meds-for-ADHD#5492554">emelenjr</a>: "<i>Your profile suggests you're in Katy, TX, and a cursory search came up with a few results for ADHD evaluation there. </i>"<br/>
<br/>
Please don't ever take information from someone's profile and use post it on the site, in any way, <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/content_policy.mefi">that violates the Content Policy</a>. <br/>
<br/>
Certainly you were doing it with the best of intentions, but this is a privacy issue and we normally such content and issue some sort of ban, temporary or permanent.<br/>
<br/>
In this instance, I reached out to the OP and they said the link in their profile that mentioned a location (thedryer.com) was just a joke and they live nowhere near there. <br/>
<br/>
Which is great news, but everyone, <strong>do not post information from a user's profile</strong>. Feel free to ask or request information, but do not take it upon yourself to mention anyone's profile information. Doing so could result in removal of the content and possible ban.  <br/>
<br/>
In this case, no bans have issued. </div>
