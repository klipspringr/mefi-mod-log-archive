<div>The post was flagged as offensive several times,  a few mentioning the title.<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to redo a post about Israel attacking Iran of course, but perhaps this isn't the time to be clever with the title and subject, based on flag feedback. Not everyone has to be on the same wavelength about this, but if people are calling the post offensive and wanting to talk about that instead of the event itself, it's probably good to make the post differently. </div>
