<div> One deleted at poster's request: wrong thread. 

EDIT: And two more, because they too reported having posted here by mistake somehow. No problem: one was of minimal substance, the other's author I have MeMailed their text for reposting elsewhere (if they so desire). Apologies for the inconvenience either way.

The server gremlins seems happy though -- no clue why that happened to several of you. <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/contact/">Let us know</a> if you can't post in future somehow? Thanks!</div>
