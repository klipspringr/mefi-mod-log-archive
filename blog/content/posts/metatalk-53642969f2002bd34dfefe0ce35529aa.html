<div>None of this is meant as a "told ya so". We do support the removal of the Meta Queue and recognize that this change will come with new complications but I'm sure we can sort them out  with your input.<br/>
<br/>
Based on the comments above and <a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26670/governance">here</a> it looks like the best course of action is to close both threads given that there are others already open about <a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26657/A-MeFiCoFo-board-election-should-be-held-in-June">governanace</a>, <a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26669/Improving-structural-elements-of-Metatalk-for-our-community-future">MetaTalk</a> and the <a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26667/Removing-the-MetaTalk-queue">Meta Queue</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Please continue the conversation there and let us know if anything else is needed. </div>
