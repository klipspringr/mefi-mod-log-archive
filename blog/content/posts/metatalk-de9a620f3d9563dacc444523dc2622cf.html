<br/>
Whether an account is closed by the member or by mods, it can only be reopened by mods.<br/>
<br/>
The HonestAlly-sock account has several notes on it reminding us not to unban it at all. It's permanently closed. <br/>
<br/>
The Tiamat account is noted not to be unbanned unless we have a talk with the user and make it clear that their behavior on trans issues is unacceptable and if we do reopen it, anything vaguely resembling previous behavior will result in a permanent ban. </div>
