<div>To me it sounds like someone realizes that they created more of problem for themselves than they intended and are now asking for the discussion to move on without them. Seeing at they've cited fears of harassment, it would be totally fine to do that. There's no need to demand that they must participate, nor that we focus on them.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, it's important to note that harassment of another member is strictly forbidden and anyone experiencing <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/contact/">should let the mods know</a> and we'll deal with it. </div>
