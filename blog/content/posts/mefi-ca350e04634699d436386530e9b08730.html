Original comment removed, reproduced here for the public record, replies to it left up to remind everyone this comment was not ok.  

This is a hateful comment against a fellow member of the site. The general 'fuck AI' was ok, but taking the time and thought to extend it to the OP <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/content_policy.mefi">violates the Content Policy</a> and causes this one day suspension.   </div>
