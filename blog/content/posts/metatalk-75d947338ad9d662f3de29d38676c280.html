I have another question: Is it expected that moderators will read every AskMe question that gets posted? Is it up to individual mods how much they want to read of the site, as long as they're responding to flags?<br/>
<br/>
It's just surprising that no one noticed those two duplicate questions before approving them. The topics were pretty memorable.</i>"<br/>
<br/>
It is expected that we read most of the site, but that isnâ€™t always possible, depending on what else is going. Something public or private might be happening that demands more immediate attention.<br/>
