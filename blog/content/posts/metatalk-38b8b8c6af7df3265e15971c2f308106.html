<div><a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26621/the-need-for-clear-action-against-transphobia#1440004">june_dodecahedron</a>: "<i>Yes, mods, will the transphobes from <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/208456/news-from-rainy-fascist-terf-island">this thread</a> be banned?</i>"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, bluemat and Czjewels have been permanently banned for being transphobic and <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/208456/news-from-rainy-fascist-terf-island#8713597">a note has been left in that thread stating so</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Frimble originally noticed the comments and reached out to the mod on duty, goodnewsfortheinsane, who removed the comments and put a note in the mod Slack requesting another opinion on whether the two accounts should be banned. I happened to be up and noticed what was going on, told gnfti that a perm ban made sense. Gnfti went ahead and did the actual banning, made a goof and temporarily banned fight or flight, Rhaomi pointed that out and the mistake was quickly corrected. <br/>
<br/>
Apologies about that fight or flick, it was a mistake on our part and quickly made right.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, yes we are serious about being more aggressive about transphobia on the site. </div>
